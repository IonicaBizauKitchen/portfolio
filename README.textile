h2. Overview

This is the source for my portfolio site. It's built with Actionscript 3 (AS3) and leverages Backpack as a backend CMS. For the moment, it's also getting a little help from PHP, which does the HTTP authentication bit using cURL, and passes the resulting XML to Flash.

h2. Notes

* SSL must be disabled on the backpack account for this to work
* Backpack API key can be enabled and retrieved on the 'My Info' page in Backpack.

h3. Upcoming

* TODO: See if the pages must be set to public to work.
* TODO: Add AS3 HTTP authentication.. see http://code.google.com/p/as3httpclient/ or http://lab.arc90.com/2008/03/restservice.php
* TODO: Move top-level XML parsing logic into the base document class
